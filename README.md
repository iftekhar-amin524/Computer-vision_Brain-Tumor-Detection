# Computer vision_Brain Tumor Detection
 Cancer is one of the top causes of death worldwide in the twenty-first century. It resulted in the deaths of 8.2 million people (around 22 percent of all deaths not related to communicable diseases; most recent data from WHO). Cancer have been identified as the uncontrollable development of abnormal cells in any portion of the anatomy. Tumor cells, commonly known as malignant cells, are these diseased cells. There are more nearly 200 different types of cancer. Prostate, lung, breast, brain tumors, leukemia, and colorectal cancer are the most severe cancers. Cancer-related mortality are expected to continue to grow, with an estimated 13.1 million deaths in 2030. (about a 70 percent increase). Furthermore, between 30 and 50 percentage of tumors can now be avoided by avoiding risk factors and using existing evidencebased prevention action. Accurate diagnosis of cancer, as well as appropriate treatment and care for patients who develop cancer, can help to lower the cancer burden. Many cancers have a strong chance of being cured if diagnosed early and treated effectively. As a result, we created a CNN-based object detection system that can detect brain tumors from x-rays of the brain.
